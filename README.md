# CookieList by [@RoamingCookie](https://anilist/user/RoamingCookie)

allows you to calculate the REAL number of anime you have watched instead of the titles watched count provided by the AniList
and many more statistics, and provide a endpoint to generate badges and svg to put inside your AniList bios.
which are updated live every time you visit the [site](https://roamingcookie.github.io/).
