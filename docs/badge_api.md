# The Friendly Neighbourhood Guide To Customize badges

GOTFO and read `\badge` and `\svg` endpoints [here](/docs/endpoint)

after that read [this](/docs/replace) to know what what data you can show inside badges


# General Info

btw you can even change some thing on your home page, like custom css or background music
this is not the part of the API, and users can enable or disable them from the settings
use 

`?css=link_to_css_file` and `?music=link_to_music_file`

further more you can use `?user=USERNAME`, that will save the trouble of writing it in the box, or if you are sharing it with someone 

<br><br>

now on the topic, there's a login with anilist button in the settings but thats optional, its for users who have set their account to private, and still want to use the site (the API key is stored in your browser, the privacy thingy)

you might wanna know the color codes too,

RED - you haven't watched and its in planning or not even in the list

BLUE - you have dropped it

GREEN - you haven't watched or watching, but its airing 

YELLOW - its not yet released or canceled
